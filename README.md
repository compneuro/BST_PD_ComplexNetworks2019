# BST_PD_ComplexNetworks2019
A computational model of mapping TNFa signalling in Parkinson's disease(PD) has been developed to understand how it mediates glutamate excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation leading to disease pathogenesis and progression. Pathways were modeled and simulated using the  biochemical pathway visualization program CellDesigner, a modeling tool for gene-regulatory  and biochemical networks that support graphical notation and listing of symbols. The model allows  a qualitative analysis of PD and a key signalling pathways for evaluating PD treatment conditions  relating pathophysiology to molecular concentration changes recordable from biological experiments.
